### Executor Framework:
- Executor: 
  - An interface that represents an object capable of executing submitted tasks, typically virtual threads.
- ExecutorService: 
  - A higher-level interface that extends Executor and provides additional methods for managing the lifecycle of tasks and obtaining Future objects for task completion.

### Thread Pools:
- Executors: 
  - A utility class that provides factory methods for creating different types of ExecutorService instances, including thread pools.
### Callable and Future:
- Callable: 
  - An interface similar to Runnable but capable of returning a result.
- Future: A placeholder for the result of a computation, allowing asynchronous retrieval.
### CompletionStage and CompletableFuture:
- CompletionStage: 
  - Represents a stage of a possibly asynchronous computation, providing methods for chaining dependent actions.
- CompletableFuture: 
  - A class implementing CompletionStage that also allows explicitly setting the result of a computation.
### Concurrent Collections:
- Various concurrent collection classes such as ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and ConcurrentLinkedQueue that are designed to be safely used by multiple threads.
### Synchronization Utilities:
- Classes like CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and CyclicBarrier for coordinating the execution of threads.
